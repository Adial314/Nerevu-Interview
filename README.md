# Nerevu Interview
A response to the API development questions for a technical interview with Nerevu Group.

To run the API, please make sure that you have Flask installed with your python distribution. Then navigate to the directory of API.py and run it using python. Finally, open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000/ and you will have arrived at the home screen of the API with instructions and development documentation to aid the user in understanding how the API can be used.

I have invested heavily in designing excellent documentation within the API so I will leave the `homepage.html` and `dev_docs.html` pages to explain the details of this code.

Thank you,
Austin
